Well, shit. I thought I had it all worked out, but was not able to push through the terminal. Now it is 8:47 pm on the due date and I have no gas left in the tank. 
I also created a place for the site on Render but wasn't able to connect to the repository. The form is set up to save to the json, but there must be a glitch there too.
The good news is that the nav bar is working, including the links and css, so it is not a total loss.
